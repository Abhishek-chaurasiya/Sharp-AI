```bash

Objective: To design and develop a simplified web application using React.js.
This assignment will evaluate your ability to create seamless navigation using React Router,
form input validation, error handling, and your proficiency in writing clean, readable code.

1.Template Libraries:Material Ui
2.React Router Navigation: Navigating with the help od react-router-dom
3.Transaction Page (Form Input Validation checks):
  On Transaction page, create a form that asks for the user's wallet address and amount.
  Implemented valid wallet address using regular expression(0x1f9090aae28b8a3dceadf281b0f12828e676c326).
  Amount: Entered amount is within provided range
4. Data Page:
  Fetched data from the open-source API using Axios - 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'. -
  Implemented the filtered data in a table format as well as in pie chart.
5.Error Handling : React toastify to show corresponding error

6.Right now it is not responsive but i can work on it to do that.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
